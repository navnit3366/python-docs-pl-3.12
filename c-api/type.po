msgid "Type Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "The C structure of the objects used to describe built-in types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the type object for type objects; it is the same object as :class:"
"`type` in the Python layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return non-zero if the object *o* is a type object, including instances of "
"types derived from the standard type object.  Return 0 in all other cases. "
"This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return non-zero if the object *o* is a type object, but not a subtype of the "
"standard type object.  Return 0 in all other cases.  This function always "
"succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Clear the internal lookup cache. Return the current version tag."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_flags` member of *type*. This "
"function is primarily meant for use with ``Py_LIMITED_API``; the individual "
"flag bits are guaranteed to be stable across Python releases, but access to :"
"c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_flags` itself is not part of the limited API."
msgstr ""

msgid "The return type is now ``unsigned long`` rather than ``long``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Invalidate the internal lookup cache for the type and all of its subtypes.  "
"This function must be called after any manual modification of the attributes "
"or base classes of the type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return non-zero if the type object *o* sets the feature *feature*. Type "
"features are denoted by single bit flags."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if the type object includes support for the cycle detector; this "
"tests the type flag :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return true if *a* is a subtype of *b*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function only checks for actual subtypes, which means that :meth:"
"`~class.__subclasscheck__` is not called on *b*.  Call :c:func:"
"`PyObject_IsSubclass` to do the same check that :func:`issubclass` would do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generic handler for the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_alloc` slot of a type "

"instance and initialize all its contents to ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generic handler for the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_new` slot of a type "

"tp_alloc` slot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finalize a type object.  This should be called on all type objects to finish "
"their initialization.  This function is responsible for adding inherited "
"slots from a type's base class.  Return ``0`` on success, or return ``-1`` "
"and sets an exception on error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If some of the base classes implements the GC protocol and the provided type "
"does not include the :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` in its flags, then the GC "
"protocol will be automatically implemented from its parents. On the "
"contrary, if the type being created does include :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC` "
"in its flags then it **must** implement the GC protocol itself by at least "
"implementing the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` handle."

"``__qualname__`` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the function pointer stored in the given slot. If the result is "
"``NULL``, this indicates that either the slot is ``NULL``, or that the "
"function was called with invalid parameters. Callers will typically cast the "
"result pointer into the appropriate function type."
msgstr ""

":c:func:`PyType_GetSlot` can now accept all types. Previously, it was "

"Return the module object associated with the given type when the type was "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no module is associated with the given type, sets :py:class:`TypeError` "
"and returns ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is usually used to get the module in which a method is "
"defined. Note that in such a method, ``PyType_GetModule(Py_TYPE(self))`` may "
"not return the intended result. ``Py_TYPE(self)`` may be a *subclass* of the "
"intended class, and subclasses are not necessarily defined in the same "
"module as their superclass. See :c:type:`PyCMethod` to get the class that "
"defines the method. See :c:func:`PyType_GetModuleByDef` for cases when "
"``PyCMethod`` cannot be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the state of the module object associated with the given type. This "

"If the *type* has an associated module but its state is ``NULL``, returns "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *bases* argument can be used to specify base classes; it can either be "
"only one class or a tuple of classes. If *bases* is ``NULL``, the "
"*Py_tp_bases* slot is used instead. If that also is ``NULL``, the "
"*Py_tp_base* slot is used instead. If that also is ``NULL``, the new type "
"derives from :class:`object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *module* argument can be used to record the module in which the new "

msgid ":mod:`aifc` --- Read and write AIFF and AIFC files"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/aifc.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`aifc` module is deprecated (see :pep:`PEP 594 <594#aifc>` for "
"details)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides support for reading and writing AIFF and AIFF-C files. "
"AIFF is Audio Interchange File Format, a format for storing digital audio "
"samples in a file.  AIFF-C is a newer version of the format that includes "
"the ability to compress the audio data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Audio files have a number of parameters that describe the audio data. The "
"sampling rate or frame rate is the number of times per second the sound is "
"sampled.  The number of channels indicate if the audio is mono, stereo, or "
"quadro.  Each frame consists of one sample per channel.  The sample size is "
"the size in bytes of each sample.  Thus a frame consists of ``nchannels * "
"samplesize`` bytes, and a second's worth of audio consists of ``nchannels * "
"samplesize * framerate`` bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, CD quality audio has a sample size of two bytes (16 bits), uses "
"two channels (stereo) and has a frame rate of 44,100 frames/second.  This "
"gives a frame size of 4 bytes (2\\*2), and a second's worth occupies "
"2\\*2\\*44100 bytes (176,400 bytes)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`aifc` defines the following function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open an AIFF or AIFF-C file and return an object instance with methods that "
"are described below.  The argument *file* is either a string naming a file "
"or a :term:`file object`.  *mode* must be ``'r'`` or ``'rb'`` when the file "
"must be opened for reading, or ``'w'``  or ``'wb'`` when the file must be "
"opened for writing. If omitted, ``file.mode`` is used if it exists, "
"otherwise ``'rb'`` is used.  When used for writing, the file object should "
"be seekable, unless you know ahead of time how many samples you are going to "
"write in total and use :meth:`writeframesraw` and :meth:`setnframes`. The :"
"func:`.open` function may be used in a :keyword:`with` statement.  When the :"
"keyword:`!with` block completes, the :meth:`~aifc.close` method is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Support for the :keyword:`with` statement was added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects returned by :func:`.open` when a file is opened for reading have the "
"following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the size in bytes of individual samples."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the sampling rate (number of audio frames per second)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the number of audio frames in the file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a bytes array of length 4 describing the type of compression used in "
"the audio file.  For AIFF files, the returned value is ``b'NONE'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a bytes array convertible to a human-readable description of the type "
"of compression used in the audio file.  For AIFF files, the returned value "
"is ``b'not compressed'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a :func:`~collections.namedtuple` ``(nchannels, sampwidth, "
"framerate, nframes, comptype, compname)``, equivalent to output of the :meth:"
"`get\\*` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a list of markers in the audio file.  A marker consists of a tuple of "
"three elements.  The first is the mark ID (an integer), the second is the "
"mark position in frames from the beginning of the data (an integer), the "
"third is the name of the mark (a string)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the tuple as described in :meth:`getmarkers` for the mark with the "
"given *id*."

msgid ""
"Read and return the next *nframes* frames from the audio file.  The returned "

"Rewind the read pointer.  The next :meth:`readframes` will start from the "
"beginning."
msgstr ""

msgid "Seek to the specified frame number."

msgid "Return the current frame number."

msgid ""
"Close the AIFF file.  After calling this method, the object can no longer be "
"used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects returned by :func:`.open` when a file is opened for writing have all "
"the above methods, except for :meth:`readframes` and :meth:`setpos`.  In "
"addition the following methods exist.  The :meth:`get\\*` methods can only "
"be called after the corresponding :meth:`set\\*` methods have been called.  "
"Before the first :meth:`writeframes` or :meth:`writeframesraw`, all "
"parameters except for the number of frames must be filled in."

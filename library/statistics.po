"Return the sample arithmetic mean of *data* which can be a sequence or "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The arithmetic mean is the sum of the data divided by the number of data "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mean is strongly affected by `outliers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Outlier>`_ and is not necessarily a typical example of the data points. For "

"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency>`_, see :func:`median`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sample mean gives an unbiased estimate of the true population mean, so "
"that when taken on average over all the possible samples, ``mean(sample)`` "
"converges on the true mean of the entire population.  If *data* represents "

"equivalent to calculating the true population mean Î¼."
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert *data* to floats and compute the arithmetic mean."

msgid ""
"This runs faster than the :func:`mean` function and it always returns a :"

"Return the harmonic mean of *data*, a sequence or iterable of real-valued "
"numbers.  If *weights* is omitted or *None*, then equal weighting is assumed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic :func:`mean` of the "

"*b* and *c* will be equivalent to ``3/(1/a + 1/b + 1/c)``.  If one of the "
"values is zero, the result will be zero."
msgstr ""

"The harmonic mean is a type of average, a measure of the central location of "

"example speeds."

"middle two\" method.  If *data* is empty, :exc:`StatisticsError` is raised. "
"*data* can be a sequence or iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The median is a robust measure of central location and is less affected by "
"the presence of outliers.  When the number of data points is odd, the middle "
"data point is returned:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the number of data points is even, the median is interpolated by taking "

"This is suited for when your data is discrete, and you don't mind that the "
"median may not be an actual data point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"In the following example, the data are rounded, so that each value "

msgid ""
"Return the population variance of *data*, a non-empty sequence or iterable "

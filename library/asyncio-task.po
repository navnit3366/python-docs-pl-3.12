"This section outlines high-level asyncio APIs to work with coroutines and "
"Tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Coroutines"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/asyncio/coroutines.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":term:`Coroutines <coroutine>` declared with the async/await syntax is the "
"preferred way of writing asyncio applications.  For example, the following "
"snippet of code prints \"hello\", waits 1 second, and then prints \"world\"::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides the following mechanisms:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`asyncio.run` function to run the top-level entry point \"main()\" "
"function (see the above example.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Awaiting on a coroutine.  The following snippet of code will print \"hello\" "
"after waiting for 1 second, and then print \"world\" after waiting for "
"*another* 2 seconds::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Expected output::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`asyncio.create_task` function to run coroutines concurrently as "
"asyncio :class:`Tasks <Task>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's modify the above example and run two ``say_after`` coroutines "
"*concurrently*::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster "
"than before::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` class provides a more modern alternative to :"
"func:`create_task`. Using this API, the last example becomes::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The timing and output should be the same as for the previous version."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`asyncio.TaskGroup`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Awaitables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We say that an object is an **awaitable** object if it can be used in an :"
"keyword:`await` expression.  Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept "
"awaitables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are three main types of *awaitable* objects: **coroutines**, "
"**Tasks**, and **Futures**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python coroutines are *awaitables* and therefore can be awaited from other "
"coroutines::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this documentation the term \"coroutine\" can be used for two closely "
"related concepts:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a *coroutine function*: an :keyword:`async def` function;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a *coroutine object*: an object returned by calling a *coroutine function*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Tasks* are used to schedule coroutines *concurrently*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a coroutine is wrapped into a *Task* with functions like :func:`asyncio."
"create_task` the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Futures"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`Future` is a special **low-level** awaitable object that "
"represents an **eventual result** of an asynchronous operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a Future object is *awaited* it means that the coroutine will wait "
"until the Future is resolved in some other place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used "
"with async/await."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally **there is no need** to create Future objects at the application "
"level code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be "
"awaited::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is :meth:"
"`loop.run_in_executor`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/asyncio/tasks.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wrap the *coro* :ref:`coroutine <coroutine>` into a :class:`Task` and "
"schedule its execution.  Return the Task object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *name* is not ``None``, it is set as the name of the task using :meth:"
"`Task.set_name`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom :"
"class:`contextvars.Context` for the *coro* to run in. The current context "
"copy is created when no *context* is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The task is executed in the loop returned by :func:`get_running_loop`, :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised if there is no running loop in current thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task` is a newer alternative that allows for "
"convenient waiting for a group of related tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save a reference to the result of this function, to avoid a task "
"disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps weak references to "
"tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere may get garbage collected at "
"any time, even before it's done. For reliable \"fire-and-forget\" background "
"tasks, gather them in a collection::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *name* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *context* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Task Cancellation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tasks can easily and safely be cancelled. When a task is cancelled, :exc:"
"`asyncio.CancelledError` will be raised in the task at the next opportunity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is recommended that coroutines use ``try/finally`` blocks to robustly "
"perform clean-up logic. In case :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` is explicitly "
"caught, it should generally be propagated when clean-up is complete. :exc:"
"`asyncio.CancelledError` directly subclasses :exc:`BaseException` so most "
"code will not need to be aware of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The asyncio components that enable structured concurrency, like :class:"
"`asyncio.TaskGroup` and :func:`asyncio.timeout`, are implemented using "
"cancellation internally and might misbehave if a coroutine swallows :exc:"
"`asyncio.CancelledError`. Similarly, user code should not generally call :"
"meth:`uncancel <asyncio.Task.uncancel>`. However, in cases when suppressing :"
"exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` is truly desired, it is necessary to also call "
"``uncancel()`` to completely remove the cancellation state."
msgstr ""

msgid "Task Groups"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Task groups combine a task creation API with a convenient and reliable way "
"to wait for all tasks in the group to finish."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :ref:`asynchronous context manager <async-context-managers>` holding a "
"group of tasks. Tasks can be added to the group using :meth:`create_task`. "
"All tasks are awaited when the context manager exits."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a task in this task group. The signature matches that of :func:"
"`asyncio.create_task`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``async with`` statement will wait for all tasks in the group to finish. "
"While waiting, new tasks may still be added to the group (for example, by "
"passing ``tg`` into one of the coroutines and calling ``tg.create_task()`` "
"in that coroutine). Once the last task has finished and the ``async with`` "
"block is exited, no new tasks may be added to the group."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first time any of the tasks belonging to the group fails with an "
"exception other than :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError`, the remaining tasks in "
"the group are cancelled. No further tasks can then be added to the group. At "
"this point, if the body of the ``async with`` statement is still active (i."
"e., :meth:`~object.__aexit__` hasn't been called yet), the task directly "
"containing the ``async with`` statement is also cancelled. The resulting :"
"exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` will interrupt an ``await``, but it will not "
"bubble out of the containing ``async with`` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once all tasks have finished, if any tasks have failed with an exception "
"other than :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError`, those exceptions are combined in "
"an :exc:`ExceptionGroup` or :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup` (as appropriate; see "
"their documentation) which is then raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two base exceptions are treated specially: If any task fails with :exc:"
"`KeyboardInterrupt` or :exc:`SystemExit`, the task group still cancels the "
"remaining tasks and waits for them, but then the initial :exc:"
"`KeyboardInterrupt` or :exc:`SystemExit` is re-raised instead of :exc:"
"`ExceptionGroup` or :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the body of the ``async with`` statement exits with an exception (so :"
"meth:`~object.__aexit__` is called with an exception set), this is treated "
"the same as if one of the tasks failed: the remaining tasks are cancelled "
"and then waited for, and non-cancellation exceptions are grouped into an "
"exception group and raised. The exception passed into :meth:`~object."
"__aexit__`, unless it is :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError`, is also included in "
"the exception group. The same special case is made for :exc:"
"`KeyboardInterrupt` and :exc:`SystemExit` as in the previous paragraph."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sleeping"
msgstr ""

msgid "Block for *delay* seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *result* is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine "
"completes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``sleep()`` always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting the delay to 0 provides an optimized path to allow other tasks to "
"run. This can be used by long-running functions to avoid blocking the event "
"loop for the full duration of the function call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Removed the *loop* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running Tasks Concurrently"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run :ref:`awaitable objects <asyncio-awaitables>` in the *aws* sequence "
"*concurrently*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any awaitable in *aws* is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a "
"Task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate "
"list of returned values.  The order of result values corresponds to the "
"order of awaitables in *aws*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *return_exceptions* is ``False`` (default), the first raised exception is "
"immediately propagated to the task that awaits on ``gather()``.  Other "
"awaitables in the *aws* sequence **won't be cancelled** and will continue to "
"run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *return_exceptions* is ``True``, exceptions are treated the same as "
"successful results, and aggregated in the result list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``gather()`` is *cancelled*, all submitted awaitables (that have not "
"completed yet) are also *cancelled*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any Task or Future from the *aws* sequence is *cancelled*, it is treated "
"as if it raised :exc:`CancelledError` -- the ``gather()`` call is **not** "
"cancelled in this case.  This is to prevent the cancellation of one "
"submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A more modern way to create and run tasks concurrently and wait for their "
"completion is :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *return_exceptions* is False, cancelling gather() after it has been "
"marked done won't cancel any submitted awaitables. For instance, gather can "
"be marked done after propagating an exception to the caller, therefore, "
"calling ``gather.cancel()`` after catching an exception (raised by one of "
"the awaitables) from gather won't cancel any other awaitables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *gather* itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated "
"regardless of *return_exceptions*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if no positional arguments are provided or "
"not all positional arguments are Future-like objects and there is no running "
"event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shielding From Cancellation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Protect an :ref:`awaitable object <asyncio-awaitables>` from being :meth:"
"`cancelled <Task.cancel>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "If *aw* is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task."
msgstr ""

msgid "The statement::"
msgstr ""

msgid "is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*except* that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running "
"in ``something()`` is not cancelled.  From the point of view of "
"``something()``, the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is "
"still cancelled, so the \"await\" expression still raises a :exc:"
"`CancelledError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``something()`` is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) "
"that would also cancel ``shield()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the "
"``shield()`` function should be combined with a try/except clause, as "
"follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save a reference to tasks passed to this function, to avoid a task "
"disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps weak references to "
"tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere may get garbage collected at "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if *aw* is not Future-like object and there "
"is no running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Timeouts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :ref:`asynchronous context manager <async-context-managers>` that can be "
"used to limit the amount of time spent waiting on something."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*delay* can either be ``None``, or a float/int number of seconds to wait. If "
"*delay* is ``None``, no time limit will be applied; this can be useful if "
"the delay is unknown when the context manager is created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In either case, the context manager can be rescheduled after creation using :"
"meth:`Timeout.reschedule`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``long_running_task`` takes more than 10 seconds to complete, the context "
"manager will cancel the current task and handle the resulting :exc:`asyncio."
"CancelledError` internally, transforming it into an :exc:`asyncio."
"TimeoutError` which can be caught and handled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`asyncio.timeout` context manager is what transforms the :exc:"
"`asyncio.CancelledError` into an :exc:`asyncio.TimeoutError`, which means "
"the :exc:`asyncio.TimeoutError` can only be caught *outside* of the context "
"manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example of catching :exc:`asyncio.TimeoutError`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The context manager produced by :func:`asyncio.timeout` can be rescheduled "
"to a different deadline and inspected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :ref:`asynchronous context manager <async-context-managers>` for "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wait for the *aw* :ref:`awaitable <asyncio-awaitables>` to complete with a "

"*timeout* can either be ``None`` or a float or int number of seconds to wait "

"If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises :exc:`TimeoutError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid the task :meth:`cancellation <Task.cancel>`, wrap it in :func:"
"`shield`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total "

"cancellation, it is propagated."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the wait is cancelled, the future *aw* is also cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When *aw* is cancelled due to a timeout, ``wait_for`` waits for *aw* to be "

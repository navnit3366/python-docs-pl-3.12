msgid ":mod:`wave` --- Read and write WAV files"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/wave.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`wave` module provides a convenient interface to the WAV sound "
"format. Only files using ``WAVE_FORMAT_PCM`` are supported. Note that this "
"does not include files using ``WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`` even if the "
"subformat is PCM."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`wave` module defines the following function and exception:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *file* is a string, open the file by that name, otherwise treat it as a "
"file-like object.  *mode* can be:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``'rb'``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Read only mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "``'wb'``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Write only mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that it does not allow read/write WAV files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *mode* of ``'rb'`` returns a :class:`Wave_read` object, while a *mode* of "
"``'wb'`` returns a :class:`Wave_write` object.  If *mode* is omitted and a "
"file-like object is passed as *file*, ``file.mode`` is used as the default "
"value for *mode*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you pass in a file-like object, the wave object will not close it when "
"its :meth:`close` method is called; it is the caller's responsibility to "
"close the file object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`.open` function may be used in a :keyword:`with` statement.  When "
"the :keyword:`!with` block completes, the :meth:`Wave_read.close() <wave."
"Wave_read.close>` or :meth:`Wave_write.close() <wave.Wave_write.close()>` "
"method is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for unseekable files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An error raised when something is impossible because it violates the WAV "
"specification or hits an implementation deficiency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Wave_read Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wave_read objects, as returned by :func:`.open`, have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Close the stream if it was opened by :mod:`wave`, and make the instance "
"unusable.  This is called automatically on object collection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns number of audio channels (``1`` for mono, ``2`` for stereo)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns sample width in bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns sampling frequency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns number of audio frames."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns compression type (``'NONE'`` is the only supported type)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Human-readable version of :meth:`getcomptype`. Usually ``'not compressed'`` "
"parallels ``'NONE'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a :func:`~collections.namedtuple` ``(nchannels, sampwidth, "

"`get\\*` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reads and returns at most *n* frames of audio, as a :class:`bytes` object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rewind the file pointer to the beginning of the audio stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following two methods are defined for compatibility with the :mod:`aifc` "
"module, and don't do anything interesting."

msgid "Returns ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raise an error."

msgid ""
"The following two methods define a term \"position\" which is compatible "

msgstr ""

msgid "Set the file pointer to the specified position."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return current file pointer position."

msgid ""
"For seekable output streams, the ``wave`` header will automatically be "
"updated to reflect the number of frames actually written.  For unseekable "
"streams, the *nframes* value must be accurate when the first frame data is "
"written.  An accurate *nframes* value can be achieved either by calling :"
"meth:`~Wave_write.setnframes` or :meth:`~Wave_write.setparams` with the "
"number of frames that will be written before :meth:`~Wave_write.close` is "
"called and then using :meth:`~Wave_write.writeframesraw` to write the frame "
"data, or by calling :meth:`~Wave_write.writeframes` with all of the frame "
"data to be written.  In the latter case :meth:`~Wave_write.writeframes` will "
"calculate the number of frames in the data and set *nframes* accordingly "
"before writing the frame data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wave_write objects, as returned by :func:`.open`, have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure *nframes* is correct, and close the file if it was opened by :mod:"
"`wave`.  This method is called upon object collection.  It will raise an "
"exception if the output stream is not seekable and *nframes* does not match "
"the number of frames actually written."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the number of channels."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the sample width to *n* bytes."

msgid ""
"Set the number of frames to *n*.  This will be changed later if the number "
"of frames actually written is different (this update attempt will raise an "
"error if the output stream is not seekable)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the compression type and description. At the moment, only compression "
"type ``NONE`` is supported, meaning no compression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *tuple* should be ``(nchannels, sampwidth, framerate, nframes, comptype, "

msgid ""
"Write audio frames and make sure *nframes* is correct.  It will raise an "

"A :class:`ChainMap` class is provided for quickly linking a number of "

"calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class can be used to simulate nested scopes and is useful in templating."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`ChainMap` groups multiple dicts or other mappings together to "

"empty dictionary is provided so that a new chain always has at least one "

msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Counter` objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A counter tool is provided to support convenient and rapid tallies. For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`Counter` is a :class:`dict` subclass for counting :term:`hashable` "
"objects. It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and "
"their counts are stored as dictionary values.  Counts are allowed to be any "
"integer value including zero or negative counts.  The :class:`Counter` class "
"is similar to bags or multisets in other languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elements are counted from an *iterable* or initialized from another "
"*mapping* (or counter):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Counter objects have a dictionary interface except that they return a zero "
"count for missing items instead of raising a :exc:`KeyError`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting a count to zero does not remove an element from a counter. Use "
"``del`` to remove it entirely:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a :class:`dict` subclass, :class:`Counter` inherited the capability to "
"remember insertion order.  Math operations on *Counter* objects also "
"preserve order.  Results are ordered according to when an element is first "
"encountered in the left operand and then by the order encountered in the "
"right operand."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Counter objects support additional methods beyond those available for all "
"dictionaries:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count.  "
"Elements are returned in the order first encountered. If an element's count "
"is less than one, :meth:`elements` will ignore it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a list of the *n* most common elements and their counts from the most "
"common to the least.  If *n* is omitted or ``None``, :meth:`most_common` "
"returns *all* elements in the counter. Elements with equal counts are "
"ordered in the order first encountered:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elements are subtracted from an *iterable* or from another *mapping* (or "
"counter).  Like :meth:`dict.update` but subtracts counts instead of "
"replacing them.  Both inputs and outputs may be zero or negative."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compute the sum of the counts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The usual dictionary methods are available for :class:`Counter` objects "
"except for two which work differently for counters."
msgstr ""

msgid "This class method is not implemented for :class:`Counter` objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elements are counted from an *iterable* or added-in from another *mapping* "
"(or counter).  Like :meth:`dict.update` but adds counts instead of replacing "
"them.  Also, the *iterable* is expected to be a sequence of elements, not a "
"sequence of ``(key, value)`` pairs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Counters support rich comparison operators for equality, subset, and "
"superset relationships: ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``. All of "
"those tests treat missing elements as having zero counts so that "
"``Counter(a=1) == Counter(a=1, b=0)`` returns true."
msgstr ""

msgid "Rich comparison operations were added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In equality tests, missing elements are treated as having zero counts. "
"Formerly, ``Counter(a=3)`` and ``Counter(a=3, b=0)`` were considered "
"distinct."
msgstr ""

msgid "Common patterns for working with :class:`Counter` objects::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Several mathematical operations are provided for combining :class:`Counter` "
"objects to produce multisets (counters that have counts greater than zero). "
"Addition and subtraction combine counters by adding or subtracting the "
"counts of corresponding elements.  Intersection and union return the minimum "
"and maximum of corresponding counts.  Equality and inclusion compare "
"corresponding counts.  Each operation can accept inputs with signed counts, "
"but the output will exclude results with counts of zero or less."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unary addition and subtraction are shortcuts for adding an empty counter or "
"subtracting from an empty counter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Added support for unary plus, unary minus, and in-place multiset operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Counters were primarily designed to work with positive integers to represent "
"running counts; however, care was taken to not unnecessarily preclude use "
"cases needing other types or negative values.  To help with those use cases, "
"this section documents the minimum range and type restrictions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Counter` class itself is a dictionary subclass with no "
"restrictions on its keys and values.  The values are intended to be numbers "
"representing counts, but you *could* store anything in the value field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~Counter.most_common` method requires only that the values be "
"orderable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For in-place operations such as ``c[key] += 1``, the value type need only "
"support addition and subtraction.  So fractions, floats, and decimals would "
"work and negative values are supported.  The same is also true for :meth:"
"`~Counter.update` and :meth:`~Counter.subtract` which allow negative and "
"zero values for both inputs and outputs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The multiset methods are designed only for use cases with positive values. "
"The inputs may be negative or zero, but only outputs with positive values "
"are created.  There are no type restrictions, but the value type needs to "
"support addition, subtraction, and comparison."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~Counter.elements` method requires integer counts.  It ignores "
"zero and negative counts."

"Returns a new deque object initialized left-to-right (using :meth:`append`) "
"with data from *iterable*.  If *iterable* is not specified, the new deque is "
"empty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced "
"\"deck\" and is short for \"double-ended queue\").  Deques support thread-"
"safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with "
"approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Though :class:`list` objects support similar operations, they are optimized "
"for fast fixed-length operations and incur O(n) memory movement costs for "
"``pop(0)`` and ``insert(0, v)`` operations which change both the size and "
"position of the underlying data representation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *maxlen* is not specified or is ``None``, deques may grow to an arbitrary "
"length.  Otherwise, the deque is bounded to the specified maximum length.  "
"Once a bounded length deque is full, when new items are added, a "
"corresponding number of items are discarded from the opposite end.  Bounded "
"length deques provide functionality similar to the ``tail`` filter in Unix. "
"They are also useful for tracking transactions and other pools of data where "
"only the most recent activity is of interest."

"Rotate the deque *n* steps to the right.  If *n* is negative, rotate to the "

"When the deque is not empty, rotating one step to the right is equivalent to "

msgstr ""

msgid "Deque objects also provide one read-only attribute:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Maximum size of a deque or ``None`` if unbounded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to the above, deques support iteration, pickling, ``len(d)``, "

"with the :keyword:`in` operator, and subscript references such as ``d[0]`` "
"to access the first element.  Indexed access is O(1) at both ends but slows "
"to O(n) in the middle.  For fast random access, use lists instead."

"rotate` method::"

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~deque.rotate` method provides a way to implement :class:`deque` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To implement :class:`deque` slicing, use a similar approach applying :meth:"
"`~deque.rotate` to bring a target element to the left side of the deque. "
"Remove old entries with :meth:`~deque.popleft`, add new entries with :meth:"
"`~deque.extend`, and then reverse the rotation. With minor variations on "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a new tuple subclass named *typename*.  The new subclass is used to "

"The *field_names* are a sequence of strings such as ``['x', 'y']``. "

"If *rename* is true, invalid fieldnames are automatically replaced with "

"and the duplicate fieldname ``abc``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*defaults* can be ``None`` or an :term:`iterable` of default values. Since "

"Named tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, so they are "

"PyGObject provides introspection bindings for C libraries using `GObject "
"<https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/>`_.  One of these libraries is "
"the `GTK+ 3 <https://www.gtk.org/>`_ widget set. GTK+ comes with many more "
"widgets than Tkinter provides.  An online `Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial <https://"
"python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/>`_ is available."

msgid ""
"PyGTK provides bindings for an older version of the library, GTK+ 2.  It "
"provides an object oriented interface that is slightly higher level than the "
"C one.  There are also bindings to `GNOME <https://www.gnome.org/>`_.  An "
"online `tutorial <http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/index.html>`_ is "
"available."

msgid ""
"PyQt is a :program:`sip`\\ -wrapped binding to the Qt toolkit.  Qt is an "
"extensive C++ GUI application development framework that is available for "
"Unix, Windows and macOS. :program:`sip` is a tool for generating bindings "
"for C++ libraries as Python classes, and is specifically designed for Python."

msgid ""
"Also known as the Qt for Python project, PySide2 is a newer binding to the "
"Qt toolkit. It is provided by The Qt Company and aims to provide a complete "
"port of PySide to Qt 5. Compared to PyQt, its licensing scheme is friendlier "
"to non-open source applications."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python that is built around the "
"popular `wxWidgets <https://www.wxwidgets.org/>`_ (formerly wxWindows) C++ "
"toolkit.  It provides a native look and feel for applications on Windows, "
"macOS, and Unix systems by using each platform's native widgets where ever "
"possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems).  In addition to an extensive set of "
"widgets, wxPython provides classes for online documentation and context "
"sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing, low-level device context drawing, "
"drag and drop, system clipboard access, an XML-based resource format and "
"more, including an ever growing library of user-contributed modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PyGTK, PyQt, PySide2, and wxPython, all have a modern look and feel and more "
"widgets than Tkinter. In addition, there are many other GUI toolkits for "
"Python, both cross-platform, and platform-specific. See the `GUI Programming "
"<https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming>`_ page in the Python Wiki for "
"a much more complete list, and also for links to documents where the "
"different GUI toolkits are compared."

msgid ":mod:`trace` --- Trace or track Python statement execution"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/trace.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`trace` module allows you to trace program execution, generate "
"annotated statement coverage listings, print caller/callee relationships and "
"list functions executed during a program run.  It can be used in another "
"program or from the command line."
msgstr ""

msgid "`Coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/>`_"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A popular third-party coverage tool that provides HTML output along with "
"advanced features such as branch coverage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command-Line Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`trace` module can be invoked from the command line.  It can be as "
"simple as ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above will execute :file:`somefile.py` and generate annotated listings "
"of all Python modules imported during the execution into the current "
"directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Display usage and exit."
msgstr ""

msgid "Display the version of the module and exit."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added ``--module`` option that allows to run an executable module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Main options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At least one of the following options must be specified when invoking :mod:"
"`trace`.  The :option:`--listfuncs <-l>` option is mutually exclusive with "
"the :option:`--trace <-t>` and :option:`--count <-c>` options. When :option:"
"`--listfuncs <-l>` is provided, neither :option:`--count <-c>` nor :option:"
"`--trace <-t>` are accepted, and vice versa."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Produce a set of annotated listing files upon program completion that shows "
"how many times each statement was executed.  See also :option:`--coverdir <-"
"C>`, :option:`--file <-f>` and :option:`--no-report <-R>` below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Display lines as they are executed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Display the functions executed by running the program."

msgid ""
"Produce an annotated list from an earlier program run that used the :option:"
"`--count <-c>` and :option:`--file <-f>` option.  This does not execute any "
"code."

msgid "Display the calling relationships exposed by running the program."

msgid "Modifiers"

msgid ""
"Name of a file to accumulate counts over several tracing runs.  Should be "
"used with the :option:`--count <-c>` option."

"Directory where the report files go.  The coverage report for ``package."
"module`` is written to file :file:`{dir}/{package}/{module}.cover`."

"When generating annotated listings, mark lines which were not executed with "
"``>>>>>>``."

msgid ""
"When using :option:`--count <-c>` or :option:`--report <-r>`, write a brief "
"summary to stdout for each file processed."

msgid ""
"Do not generate annotated listings.  This is useful if you intend to make "
"several runs with :option:`--count <-c>`, and then produce a single set of "
"annotated listings at the end."

"Create an object to trace execution of a single statement or expression.  "
"All parameters are optional.  *count* enables counting of line numbers.  "

"*ignoredirs* is a list of directories whose modules or packages should be "
"ignored.  *infile* is the name of the file from which to read stored count "
"information.  *outfile* is the name of the file in which to write updated "
"count information.  *timing* enables a timestamp relative to when tracing "
"was started to be displayed."

"Python's interfaces for processing XML are grouped in the ``xml`` package."

"The XML modules are not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed "

msgid ""
"It is important to note that modules in the :mod:`xml` package require that "
"there be at least one SAX-compliant XML parser available. The Expat parser "
"is included with Python, so the :mod:`xml.parsers.expat` module will always "
"be available."

msgid ""
"The documentation for the :mod:`xml.dom` and :mod:`xml.sax` packages are the "
"definition of the Python bindings for the DOM and SAX interfaces."

msgid ""
":mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` doesn't expand external entities and raises a :"
"exc:`ParserError` when an entity occurs."

msgid ""
":mod:`xml.dom.minidom` doesn't expand external entities and simply returns "
"the unexpanded entity verbatim."
msgstr ""

msgid ":mod:`xmlrpclib` doesn't expand external entities and omits them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Python 3.7.1, external general entities are no longer processed by "
"default."
msgstr ""

msgid "billion laughs / exponential entity expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Billion Laughs`_ attack -- also known as exponential entity expansion "
"-- uses multiple levels of nested entities. Each entity refers to another "
"entity several times, and the final entity definition contains a small "
"string. The exponential expansion results in several gigabytes of text and "
"consumes lots of memory and CPU time."
msgstr ""

msgid "quadratic blowup entity expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a `Billion Laughs`_ attack; it "
"abuses entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one "
"large entity with a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack "
"isn't as efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering parser "
"countermeasures that forbid deeply nested entities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Entity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They "
"can also point to external resources or local files. The XML parser accesses "
"the resource and embeds the content into the XML document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some XML libraries like Python's :mod:`xml.dom.pulldom` retrieve document "
"type definitions from remote or local locations. The feature has similar "
"implications as the external entity expansion issue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decompression bombs (aka `ZIP bomb`_) apply to all XML libraries that can "
"parse compressed XML streams such as gzipped HTTP streams or LZMA-compressed "
"files. For an attacker it can reduce the amount of transmitted data by three "
"magnitudes or more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The documentation for `defusedxml`_ on PyPI has further information about "
"all known attack vectors with examples and references."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`defusedxml` Package"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`defusedxml`_ is a pure Python package with modified subclasses of all "
"stdlib XML parsers that prevent any potentially malicious operation. Use of "
"this package is recommended for any server code that parses untrusted XML "
"data. The package also ships with example exploits and extended "
"documentation on more XML exploits such as XPath injection."

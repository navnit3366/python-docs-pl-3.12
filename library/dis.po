msgid ":mod:`dis` --- Disassembler for Python bytecode"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/dis.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`dis` module supports the analysis of CPython :term:`bytecode` by "
"disassembling it. The CPython bytecode which this module takes as an input "
"is defined in the file :file:`Include/opcode.h` and used by the compiler and "
"the interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bytecode is an implementation detail of the CPython interpreter.  No "
"guarantees are made that bytecode will not be added, removed, or changed "
"between versions of Python.  Use of this module should not be considered to "
"work across Python VMs or Python releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use 2 bytes for each instruction. Previously the number of bytes varied by "
"instruction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The argument of jump, exception handling and loop instructions is now the "
"instruction offset rather than the byte offset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some instructions are accompanied by one or more inline cache entries, which "
"take the form of :opcode:`CACHE` instructions. These instructions are hidden "
"by default, but can be shown by passing ``show_caches=True`` to any :mod:"
"`dis` utility. Furthermore, the interpreter now adapts the bytecode to "
"specialize it for different runtime conditions. The adaptive bytecode can be "
"shown by passing ``adaptive=True``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example: Given the function :func:`myfunc`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"the following command can be used to display the disassembly of :func:"
"`myfunc`:"
msgstr ""

msgid "(The \"2\" is a line number)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Bytecode analysis"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bytecode analysis API allows pieces of Python code to be wrapped in a :"
"class:`Bytecode` object that provides easy access to details of the compiled "
"code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Analyse the bytecode corresponding to a function, generator, asynchronous "
"generator, coroutine, method, string of source code, or a code object (as "
"returned by :func:`compile`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a convenience wrapper around many of the functions listed below, "
"most notably :func:`get_instructions`, as iterating over a :class:`Bytecode` "
"instance yields the bytecode operations as :class:`Instruction` instances."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *first_line* is not ``None``, it indicates the line number that should be "
"reported for the first source line in the disassembled code.  Otherwise, the "
"source line information (if any) is taken directly from the disassembled "
"code object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *current_offset* is not ``None``, it refers to an instruction offset in "
"the disassembled code. Setting this means :meth:`.dis` will display a "
"\"current instruction\" marker against the specified opcode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *show_caches* is ``True``, :meth:`.dis` will display inline cache entries "
"used by the interpreter to specialize the bytecode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *adaptive* is ``True``, :meth:`.dis` will display specialized bytecode "
"that may be different from the original bytecode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Construct a :class:`Bytecode` instance from the given traceback, setting "
"*current_offset* to the instruction responsible for the exception."
msgstr ""

msgid "The compiled code object."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first source line of the code object (if available)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a formatted view of the bytecode operations (the same as printed by :"
"func:`dis.dis`, but returned as a multi-line string)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a formatted multi-line string with detailed information about the "
"code object, like :func:`code_info`."
msgstr ""

msgid "This can now handle coroutine and asynchronous generator objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *show_caches* and *adaptive* parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Analysis functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`dis` module also defines the following analysis functions that "
"convert the input directly to the desired output. They can be useful if only "
"a single operation is being performed, so the intermediate analysis object "
"isn't useful:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a formatted multi-line string with detailed code object information "
"for the supplied function, generator, asynchronous generator, coroutine, "
"method, source code string or code object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the exact contents of code info strings are highly implementation "
"dependent and they may change arbitrarily across Python VMs or Python "
"releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print detailed code object information for the supplied function, method, "
"source code string or code object to *file* (or ``sys.stdout`` if *file* is "
"not specified)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a convenient shorthand for ``print(code_info(x), file=file)``, "
"intended for interactive exploration at the interpreter prompt."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added *file* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Disassemble the *x* object.  *x* can denote either a module, a class, a "
"method, a function, a generator, an asynchronous generator, a coroutine, a "
"code object, a string of source code or a byte sequence of raw bytecode. For "
"a module, it disassembles all functions. For a class, it disassembles all "
"methods (including class and static methods). For a code object or sequence "
"of raw bytecode, it prints one line per bytecode instruction. It also "
"recursively disassembles nested code objects (the code of comprehensions, "
"generator expressions and nested functions, and the code used for building "
"nested classes). Strings are first compiled to code objects with the :func:"
"`compile` built-in function before being disassembled.  If no object is "
"provided, this function disassembles the last traceback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The disassembly is written as text to the supplied *file* argument if "
"provided and to ``sys.stdout`` otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The maximal depth of recursion is limited by *depth* unless it is ``None``. "
"``depth=0`` means no recursion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *show_caches* is ``True``, this function will display inline cache "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *adaptive* is ``True``, this function will display specialized bytecode "

msgstr ""

msgid "Implemented recursive disassembling and added *depth* parameter."

"Disassemble the top-of-stack function of a traceback, using the last "
"traceback if none was passed.  The instruction causing the exception is "
"indicated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Disassemble a code object, indicating the last instruction if *lasti* was "

msgstr ""

msgid "a labelled instruction, indicated with ``>>``,"

msgid "operation parameters, and"

msgid "interpretation of the parameters in parentheses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The parameter interpretation recognizes local and global variable names, "
"constant values, branch targets, and compare operators."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an iterator over the instructions in the supplied function, method, "
"source code string or code object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The iterator generates a series of :class:`Instruction` named tuples giving "
"the details of each operation in the supplied code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *show_caches* and *adaptive* parameters work as they do in :func:`dis`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This generator function uses the ``co_lines`` method of the code object "
"*code* to find the offsets which are starts of lines in the source code.  "
"They are generated as ``(offset, lineno)`` pairs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Line numbers can be decreasing. Before, they were always increasing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :pep:`626` ``co_lines`` method is used instead of the ``co_firstlineno`` "
"and ``co_lnotab`` attributes of the code object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Detect all offsets in the raw compiled bytecode string *code* which are jump "
"targets, and return a list of these offsets."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compute the stack effect of *opcode* with argument *oparg*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the code has a jump target and *jump* is ``True``, :func:`~stack_effect` "
"will return the stack effect of jumping.  If *jump* is ``False``, it will "
"return the stack effect of not jumping. And if *jump* is ``None`` (default), "

msgstr ""

msgid "Added *jump* parameter."

msgid "Swap TOS with the item at position *i*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather than being an actual instruction, this opcode is used to mark extra "

"itself. It is automatically hidden by all ``dis`` utilities, but can be "
"viewed with ``show_caches=True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Logically, this space is part of the preceding instruction. Many opcodes "
"expect to be followed by an exact number of caches, and will instruct the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Populated caches can look like arbitrary instructions, so great care should "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In-place operations are like binary operations, in that they remove TOS and "

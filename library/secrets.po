msgid ":mod:`secrets` --- Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/secrets.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`secrets` module is used for generating cryptographically strong "
"random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account "
"authentication, security tokens, and related secrets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In particular, :mod:`secrets` should be used in preference to the default "
"pseudo-random number generator in the :mod:`random` module, which is "
"designed for modelling and simulation, not security or cryptography."
msgstr ""

msgid ":pep:`506`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Random numbers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`secrets` module provides access to the most secure source of "
"randomness that your operating system provides."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A class for generating random numbers using the highest-quality sources "
"provided by the operating system.  See :class:`random.SystemRandom` for "
"additional details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a randomly chosen element from a non-empty sequence."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a random int in the range [0, *n*)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return an int with *k* random bits."
msgstr ""

msgid "Generating tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`secrets` module provides functions for generating secure tokens, "
"suitable for applications such as password resets, hard-to-guess URLs, and "
"similar."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random byte string containing *nbytes* number of bytes. If *nbytes* "
"is ``None`` or not supplied, a reasonable default is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random text string, in hexadecimal.  The string has *nbytes* random "
"bytes, each byte converted to two hex digits.  If *nbytes* is ``None`` or "
"not supplied, a reasonable default is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random URL-safe text string, containing *nbytes* random bytes.  The "
"text is Base64 encoded, so on average each byte results in approximately 1.3 "
"characters.  If *nbytes* is ``None`` or not supplied, a reasonable default "
"is used."
msgstr ""

msgid "How many bytes should tokens use?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To be secure against `brute-force attacks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Brute-force_attack>`_, tokens need to have sufficient randomness.  "
"Unfortunately, what is considered sufficient will necessarily increase as "
"computers get more powerful and able to make more guesses in a shorter "
"period.  As of 2015, it is believed that 32 bytes (256 bits) of randomness "
"is sufficient for the typical use-case expected for the :mod:`secrets` "
"module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For those who want to manage their own token length, you can explicitly "
"specify how much randomness is used for tokens by giving an :class:`int` "
"argument to the various ``token_*`` functions.  That argument is taken as "
"the number of bytes of randomness to use."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Otherwise, if no argument is provided, or if the argument is ``None``, the "
"``token_*`` functions will use a reasonable default instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That default is subject to change at any time, including during maintenance "
"releases."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if strings or :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` "
"*a* and *b* are equal, otherwise ``False``, using a \"constant-time "
"compare\" to reduce the risk of `timing attacks <https://codahale.com/a-"
"lesson-in-timing-attacks/>`_. See :func:`hmac.compare_digest` for additional "
"details."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section shows recipes and best practices for using :mod:`secrets` to "
"manage a basic level of security."

msgid "Generate an eight-character alphanumeric password:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Applications should not `store passwords in a recoverable format <https://"
"cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/257.html>`_, whether plain text or "
"encrypted.  They should be salted and hashed using a cryptographically "
"strong one-way (irreversible) hash function."

"character, at least one uppercase character, and at least three digits:"

msgid ":mod:`ast` --- Abstract Syntax Trees"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/ast.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`ast` module helps Python applications to process trees of the "
"Python abstract syntax grammar.  The abstract syntax itself might change "
"with each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically "
"what the current grammar looks like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An abstract syntax tree can be generated by passing :data:`ast."
"PyCF_ONLY_AST` as a flag to the :func:`compile` built-in function, or using "
"the :func:`parse` helper provided in this module.  The result will be a tree "
"of objects whose classes all inherit from :class:`ast.AST`.  An abstract "
"syntax tree can be compiled into a Python code object using the built-in :"
"func:`compile` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Abstract Grammar"
msgstr ""

msgid "The abstract grammar is currently defined as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Node classes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the base of all AST node classes.  The actual node classes are "
"derived from the :file:`Parser/Python.asdl` file, which is reproduced :ref:"
"`above <abstract-grammar>`.  They are defined in the :mod:`_ast` C module "
"and re-exported in :mod:`ast`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is one class defined for each left-hand side symbol in the abstract "
"grammar (for example, :class:`ast.stmt` or :class:`ast.expr`).  In addition, "
"there is one class defined for each constructor on the right-hand side; "
"these classes inherit from the classes for the left-hand side trees.  For "
"example, :class:`ast.BinOp` inherits from :class:`ast.expr`.  For production "
"rules with alternatives (aka \"sums\"), the left-hand side class is "
"abstract: only instances of specific constructor nodes are ever created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each concrete class has an attribute :attr:`_fields` which gives the names "
"of all child nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each instance of a concrete class has one attribute for each child node, of "
"the type as defined in the grammar.  For example, :class:`ast.BinOp` "
"instances have an attribute :attr:`left` of type :class:`ast.expr`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If these attributes are marked as optional in the grammar (using a question "
"mark), the value might be ``None``.  If the attributes can have zero-or-more "
"values (marked with an asterisk), the values are represented as Python "
"lists.  All possible attributes must be present and have valid values when "
"compiling an AST with :func:`compile`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances of :class:`ast.expr` and :class:`ast.stmt` subclasses have :attr:"
"`lineno`, :attr:`col_offset`, :attr:`end_lineno`, and :attr:`end_col_offset` "
"attributes.  The :attr:`lineno` and :attr:`end_lineno` are the first and "
"last line numbers of source text span (1-indexed so the first line is line "
"1) and the :attr:`col_offset` and :attr:`end_col_offset` are the "
"corresponding UTF-8 byte offsets of the first and last tokens that generated "
"the node. The UTF-8 offset is recorded because the parser uses UTF-8 "
"internally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the end positions are not required by the compiler and are "
"therefore optional. The end offset is *after* the last symbol, for example "
"one can get the source segment of a one-line expression node using "
"``source_line[node.col_offset : node.end_col_offset]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The constructor of a class :class:`ast.T` parses its arguments as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are positional arguments, there must be as many as there are items "
"in :attr:`T._fields`; they will be assigned as attributes of these names."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are keyword arguments, they will set the attributes of the same "
"names to the given values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, to create and populate an :class:`ast.UnaryOp` node, you could "
"use ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "or the more compact ::"

msgid "Class :class:`ast.Constant` is now used for all constants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Simple indices are represented by their value, extended slices are "
"represented as tuples."

"Old classes :class:`ast.Num`, :class:`ast.Str`, :class:`ast.Bytes`, :class:"
"`ast.NameConstant` and :class:`ast.Ellipsis` are still available, but they "
"will be removed in future Python releases.  In the meantime, instantiating "
"them will return an instance of a different class."

msgid ""
"Old classes :class:`ast.Index` and :class:`ast.ExtSlice` are still "

msgstr ""

msgid "Expressions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an expression, such as a function call, appears as a statement by "
